              The Chosen Ones. He is kind and strong but struggles with

              Mark possesses environmental-adaptability powers, granting him
              different abilities based on his surroundings. Despite his
              involvement with a gang of street thugs, a situation forced upon
              him, he longs to leave and care for his family. The gang offers
              easy money, and the intimidating leader, Deshawn Harris, keeps
              Mark in line. However, The Chosen Ones offer Mark a chance to
              escape the gang and turn his life around if he genuinely desires
              it.
